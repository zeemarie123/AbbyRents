        <h2>Meet the A Team</h2>
        <p > Meet the founders of Abby Rents, Margot (right) and Zora (left). They have both been playing on the Abington Varsity Tennis Team since 9th grade and are devoted athletes. They are currently seniors at Abington Senior High School and hope to play tennis in college. They started Abby Rents in 2019 when they realized there was a need for affordable sports equipment. </p>
        <p >As tennis players, they know the sport is not cheap, having to buy new racquets, strings, and grips. However, they also saw how outgrowing equipment contributes to waste.</p>
